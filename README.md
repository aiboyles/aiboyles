## :star2: Hi, I'm Ann! :ringed_planet:

I'm a creative coder and empathetic communicator who thrives on variety and learning new things every day. My windy career path includes programming marine navigational software for cargo ships in the Netherlands :ship: and teaching computer science at a diverse public high school in Pasadena, CA 👩🏻‍🏫.

Some of what you'll find here are projects I used in my curriculum as a high school computer science teacher. I've taught all high school grade levels from freshmen through seniors, and had an absolute blast!

- :roller_skate: I love learning new things: my latest is roller skating! I'm VERY bad, but I'm trying and it's fun!
- :sailboat: A few of my random interests include tall ships, old books and maps, ghost stories, and broadside ballads.
- :busts_in_silhouette: I'm deeply interested in community and third spaces. I would love to see and contribute to a third place revival!
